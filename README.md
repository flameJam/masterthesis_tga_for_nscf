**info on study object Teamscale is missing because it is closed-source**

- scripts: contains scripts I used to e.g. build some latex tables in the evaluation chapter
- evaluation/"study_object"/:
  - eval_script.py: script with useful functions and values hardcoded to the respective study object
  - coverage_reports: the coverage reports for the respective study object
  - assessments: the final tga reports for the study object
  - evaluation_documentation.md : steps I took to execute test in the respective study object
  - samples: the samples I searched for false positives
  - "get_project_resource_file_extensions.sh" is the script for collecting all file-extensions in a directory and its subdirectories I mentioned in the thesis.
